# Folder structure
 - Audio files in WAV format are placed in folders named after command labels.
 - The folders are compressed into ZIP format for ease at downloading.
 - The ZIP files are placed under folder `recordings`.
# Labeling
- Command labels are ZIP file names without file extension, e.g., `dat_ho_boi`.
- Each WAV file is named in a format of `[speaker ID]_[utterance ID].wav`, e.g., `002_617cbc489e4abed84832312c.wav`.
